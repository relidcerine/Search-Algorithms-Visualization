# Search-Algorithms-Visualization

This project is a Pygame-based application to visualize various search algorithms, including:
- **Min-Max Algorithm**
- **Negamax Algorithm**
- **Alpha-Beta Pruning**

The application allows users to see how these algorithms work through interactive tree structures. You can select the algorithm, choose between `Min` or `Max` players, and watch the algorithm in action.

## Algorithms

### 1. Min-Max Algorithm
The Min-Max algorithm is used in two-player turn-based games. Each player is either a maximizer or a minimizer. The goal is to maximize the minimum gain of the opponent.

### 2. Negamax Algorithm
Negamax is a variant of Min-Max that simplifies the code by using one evaluation function instead of two.

### 3. Alpha-Beta Pruning
Alpha-Beta Pruning improves Min-Max by cutting off branches that are guaranteed not to affect the final decision.
